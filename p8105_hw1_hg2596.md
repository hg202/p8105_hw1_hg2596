    ## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g

``` r
round(mean(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm),na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## [1] 201

In the dataset `penguins` there are **344 rows** and **8 columns**. Each
row represents a penguin’s species type, island location, bill length
(mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex (m/f) and
year. For this dataset the mean flipper length is **201 mm**.

# Creating a Scatterplot

``` r
myplot2 = 
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm,col = species)) + geom_point() 


ggsave("myplot2.pdf",myplot2)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

# Problem 2

# Creating a New Dataframe

``` r
third_df = tibble(
  norm = rnorm(10),
  logical = norm > 0, 
  vec_char = c("one","two","three","two","one","one","two","one","two","three"),
  vec_fac = factor (c("one","two","three","one","two","three","one","one","two","three"),
                    levels = c("one", "two", "three" ))
  
)
```

# Taking Means of Each Variable

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,norm))
```

    ## [1] -0.1993672

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(third_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,vec_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(third_df, vec_fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Simply pulling the column from the dataset and getting the mean was
successful for the **normally distributed variable** and **logical
variable**.For the normally distributed variable it was able to take the
mean of that column because it contained all numeric. However, for the
logical variable it took a different approach because they are
characters, it gave a value for each character value for example,
labeling it a “0” or “1” : either it is there or it is not. Then, for
the mean it was able to give a value because it treated the values as
proportions.

Unlike the **vector variable** or a **factor variable** which R does not
try to give other numeric values to but just say’s “NA” because it can
not take the mean of character values.
